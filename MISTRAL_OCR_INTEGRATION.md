# Mistral OCR Integration

This document explains the implementation of OCR functionality in the PTW Analyzer app using Mistral AI's vision capabilities.

## Implementation Details

The OCR functionality was implemented using Mistral AI's vision capabilities through their chat completions API. The key components are:

1. **Vision Model**: The app uses the `pixtral-large-latest` model, which has multimodal capabilities for processing images.

2. **Image Processing Flow**:
   - The app extracts pages from PDF documents as images
   - Each image is processed with the Mistral vision API
   - The extracted text is then used for further analysis with Claude

3. **API Integration**:
   - The implementation uses the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
   - Images are encoded as base64 and sent directly in the request payload
   - The API is provided with specific instructions to extract text and identify signatures

## Code Implementation

The core functionality is in the `process_pdf_with_mistral_ocr` function:

```python
def process_pdf_with_mistral_ocr(page_image, page_num):
    """Process page image with Mistral OCR using the vision capabilities 
    of the chat completions API.
    """
    # Convert image to base64
    buffer = io.BytesIO()
    page_image.save(buffer, format="PNG")
    base64_image = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode('utf-8')
    
    # Prepare the request payload for the vision model
    payload = {
        "model": "pixtral-large-latest",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": instructions
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {
                            "url": f"data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "temperature": 0
    }
    
    # Make the API request
    response = requests.post("https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions", 
                           headers=headers, json=payload)
    
    # Extract the OCR text from the response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        result = response.json()
        if "choices" in result and len(result["choices"]) > 0:
            text = result["choices"][0].get("message", {}).get("content", "")
    
    # Return the formatted OCR text
    return ocr_prompt.format(text=cleaned_text)
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Direct Image Processing**: Unlike the previous approach, this implementation doesn't require uploading files to S3 first. The base64-encoded image is sent directly to the Mistral API.

2. **Specific Instructions**: The API is given instructions to:
   - Extract all visible text
   - Pay special attention to handwriting and signatures
   - Identify if fields are filled out
   - Report on signature presence

3. **Error Handling**: The implementation includes robust error handling and fallbacks if OCR processing fails.

## Testing

The OCR integration was tested using:

1. `test_mistral_vision.py` - Tests the basic vision capabilities of the Mistral API
2. `test_updated_ocr.py` - Tests the integrated `process_pdf_with_mistral_ocr` function

Both tests confirmed successful text extraction and signature identification from test documents.

## Notes for Future Improvements

1. **Model Selection**: Consider testing other Mistral vision models for optimal OCR performance.

2. **Instruction Optimization**: The instructions to the model could be further optimized based on specific document types.

3. **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for OCR results to improve performance for repeat analyses.

4. **Parallel Processing**: For large documents, implement parallel OCR processing to improve performance.

- When temporal context is needed (e.g., "When did this parameter start changing?")
- When equipment-specific information is required for precise diagnosis
- When formation/geological context is necessary for proper interpretation
- When operational history would significantly improve diagnostic accuracy

EXAMPLE EXPERT QUESTIONS:
- "What was the last formation drilled and what formation are you currently drilling into?"
- "Has there been any change in drilling parameters in the last __ feet/hours?"
- "What was the result of the last flow check performed?"
- "What is the current mud weight and has it been adjusted recently?"
- "Are you experiencing any hole problems (tight spots, overpull, fill) on connections?"
- "What is the BHA configuration, particularly the distance from bit to stabilizers/MWD?"
- "What differential pressure is being applied to the drilling motor during sliding operations?"
- "Has there been any sign of formation fluid in the returns?"
